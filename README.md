Part 1
In the first part of the project we observe the dataset and produce statistics about the content of the dataset. Some of the statistics are:

Number of movies/series.
Country with the most content.
Year with the most content.
The popularity of each genre for every country.


Part 2
We implement a recommendation system in order to recomend similar movies to a given movie. In order to represent each movie we tried the two following representations:

Bag Of Words (BoW)
TF-IDF
In order to compute the similarity between the repsesentations we used:

Jaccard-Tanimoto coefficient
Cosine Similarity
